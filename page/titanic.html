          chairs a group on a fast track to plan and develop specifications for 
          a major conversion of the former Navy ship USNS Capable. Following the 
          award of a conversion contract and an estimated 12 to 18 months in a 
          shipyard, the ship will be unique to NOAA and the federal fleet as the 
          only U.S. government ship dedicated to exploring Earth's oceans. &quot;If 
          we plan well now, those scientists will be equipped for success,&quot; 
          said Hammond &quot;It will be a path finding ship for discovery and 
          for mapping a route to ocean research.&quot;</font></p>

</a>&quot;We 
          are excited about the possibilities this ship offers,&quot; said Rick 
          Rosen, NOAA assistant administrator of NOAA Research. &quot;While research largely involves the testing of hypotheses, 
          scientists on this ship will do that and more&#8212;they'll be testing, 
          but also generating, hypotheses.&quot; <strong>(Click image for larger
